**Course Schedule**

In case there are problems with the internet connection, please go forward with the slides and the Jupyter notebooks! The solutions to the Jupyter notebook exercises will be provided in the afternoon! The best strategy is to download the entire repository and work on the notebooks locally. Best practice is, if you immediately make a copy of a downloaded notebook in order to always have an original. Then modify the copy!

*Tuesday*

- The focus is on understanding the Fourier transform, and estimating spectra
- In the notebook Folder P03a-c contain fundamental maths prerequisites that you are welcome to go through!
- P04 contains note books about Spectral estimation and time-frequency analysis. 
- Go from a-c, b contains the more involved exercises, c is a simple intro to convolution. 

*Wednesday*

- The focus is on convolution, deconvolution, and filtering
